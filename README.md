# N-Queen-s-Assignment
CISC 352 - Assignment 1: nQueens Problem

nQueens Problem:

The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard


Developed a program written in Python that efficiently solves the nQueens problem up to 1 million queens.

Requirements:
Python 3+

Note:
Run program using terminal/cmd to avoid additional time latency due to additional processing of IDE. 

Note:
Program sometimes incurs an extremely infrequent index error when attempting to select from the twoConflicts list in the function colConflicts. We decided to keep this error as the trade off in efficiency to compensate for this error is too great, especially when the error occurs so infrequently.
